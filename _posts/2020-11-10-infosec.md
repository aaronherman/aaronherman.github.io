title:  "Infosec resources and readings"

Throughout my career I have collected a handful of links and resources that I have found useful. I wanted to share these in case they're useful for others! Enjoy.

## Readings
Historical stories about threat actors and campaigns are really important to understanding the mindset of both attackers and defenders. The Cuckoo's Egg is my recommended introduction book, and the others are good follow on books.
- [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://amazon.com/CUCKOOS-EGG-Clifford-Stoll-ebook/dp/B0083DJXCM/)
- [Sandworm](https://amazon.com/Sandworm-Cyberwar-Kremlins-Dangerous-Hackers-ebook/dp/B07GD4MFW2)
- [Countdown to Zero Day](https://amazon.com/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital-ebook/dp/B00KEPLC08)

### CTF
A great way to learn new concepts is through challenges. In cybersecurity, there are Capture the Flag challenges/competitions that typically revolve around cryptography, ethical hacking, web exploitation, reverse engineering, and forensics.
