My name is Aaron and I work at Target as a DevOps Engineer in Cyber Security.

I am an alumni of Luther College where I studied Computer Science and Sociology and have my GCIH certification. I have an interest in information security, DevOps, infrastructure tools and web development. I founded the Computer Science Society during my senior year at Luther College, where we had weekly educational meetings, Hackathons and networking opportunities.

At IBM, I worked in their IBM Services for Managed Applications organization on addressing security compliance issues using Chef, wrote automation to bootstrap 4,000 nodes to 20+ Chef servers across different environments and developed microservices for our internal portal. My favorite project was called Gordon, where I worked on abstracting the Chef Server API across different cloud environment to cache data for easy lookup, and set toggles for security features in our cookbooks. During my internships at IBM Cloud Managed Services, I worked on creating testing environments for code orchestration using Docker, developed a continuous integration pipeline that utilized both front-end and back-end testing.
