My name is Aaron and I work at IBM as a DevOps Engineer.

I am an alumni of Luther College where I studied Computer Science and Sociology. I have an interest in information security, DevOps, infrastructure tools and web development. I founded the Computer Science Society during my senior year at Luther College, where we had weekly educational meetings, Hackathons and networking opportunities.


I currently work for IBM Services for Managed Applications on addressing security compliance issues using Chef, wrote automation to bootstrap 4,000 nodes to our Chef servers across different environments and develop microservices for our internal portal. During my internships at IBM Cloud Managed Services, I worked on creating testing environments for code orchestration using Docker, developed a continuous integration pipeline that utilized both front-end and back-end testing.
