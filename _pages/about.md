My name is Aaron Herman and I work at Target as a Threat Intelligence Detection Engineer.

I am an alumni of Luther College where I studied Computer Science and Sociology and have my GCIH and GCED certification. I have an interest in information security, DevOps, infrastructure tools and web development. I founded the Computer Science Society during my senior year at Luther College, where we had weekly educational meetings, Hackathons and networking opportunities.
